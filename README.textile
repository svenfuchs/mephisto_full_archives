h1. Mephisto Full Archives (Tricky Edition)

This is a pretty simple plugin that adds a full archives view to Mephisto's
own archives. By "full archive" simply a list of all your blog posts is meant,
most probably just titles grouped by month.

You'll need to change your templates/archive.liquid template to use this. See
lib/templates/archive.liquid.example for an example of an archive liquid
template.
